# PerceptronAlgorithm
- Implementation of a classification task using perceptron learning algorithm.
- Classification task is to be implemented on the provided excel file (DataForPerceptron.xlsx).
- In the file there are two sheets: TRAINData and TESTData. TRAINData sheet is to be used for training and TESTData sheet is to be used for testing your algorithm. 
- First, implementation of perceptron learning algorithm, then obtaining the hypothesis using the train data.
- Finally, using this hypothesis to find the class values for your test data. 
- "TestDataWithPredictions.xlsx" file includes results of perceptron algorithm classification.
